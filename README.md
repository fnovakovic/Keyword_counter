# Keyword_counter

Concurrent and distributed systems - homework 1

This project was conceived as the implementation of a system for counting occurrences of keywords in different types of corpuses.

Keyword Counting: The main purpose of the system is to count the occurrences of certain keywords within various types of corpora, including ASCII-encoded text files and HTML files on the web.

Concurrent Processing: The system should be concurrent, meaning it can process multiple corpora or jobs at the same time without blocking.

Easy addition of new components: It should be possible to add new system components relatively easily. This allows system extensibility for future requirements.

Robustness and fault management: The system should be fault tolerant and never collapse completely. Errors should be handled gracefully, and the user should be notified of problems.

Command Line Interaction (CLI): The user should be able to interact with the system via the command line, where they can enter commands to add corpora, perform searches, and other actions.

Configuration via configuration file: System settings should be read from a configuration file, allowing customization of the system without the need to change the source code.

Assignment submission and grading: The project likely involves grading or grading, and perhaps submission of results or reports.

This system is designed to analyze and count keywords in different types of textual content, be it local files or web pages. An obvious application of this system is to analyze the content of web pages or large text corpora for the purpose of searching for keywords or extracting relevant information.
